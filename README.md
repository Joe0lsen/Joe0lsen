Hi, Iâ€™m @Joe0lsen (with a zero).
I'm a software engineer, a creative probelm solver, and a dreamer.
"If you can dream it, you can do it."
"Where there is no vision, the people perish."
Software has the power to solve just about anything.

I'm interested in web/app development, 3D math and rendering, and how computers work at a low level.
I want to build useful or cool things, and I'm also curious about how computer systems work.
    
I'm currently learning ReactJS and ThreeJS.
I want to dive deaper into low-level programming, and eventually want to learn assembly language.

If you would like to contact me, my email is: olsen.jcm@gmail.com
